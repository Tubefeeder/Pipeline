# Contributing

There are a couple of ways you can contribute to Tubefeeder. You can report bugs, propose changes and additions, or directly contributing to the codebase.

## Reporting bugs / Proposing changes or additions

If you experience a bug, or you want to suggest some changes or additions within an app, you can open an issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Tubefeeder/Tubefeeder/issues). However, we heavily encourage to check if there is an existing issue first. If there is an existing issue, please leave a thumbs up (üëç).

## Submitting code

You can submit code by [forking](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks) this project, editing the desired code and finally submitting a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

## Translating

The process of translating Tubefeeder is similar to submitting code. Start with [forking](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks) the project. Then, [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the repository.

### Adding new language

To add a new language, you must first add the locale in the [`LINGAS`](po/LINGAS) file in a new line. Then, proceed to create a new file that starts with the locale and ends with the `.po` extension in [`po`](po). For example, for German, the file will be named `de.po`.
